## Overview

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  fig.path = "man/figures/README-",
  out.width = "100%"
)
```

The goal of stMix is to estimate a two-population mixture of skewed t
distributions via the EM algorithm.

## Installation

You can install the development version of stMix from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("marco-bee/stMix")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to simulate and estimate a lognormal-GPD mixture:

```{r example}
library(stMix)
y <- rfstMix(100,.9,0,1,3)
res <- stMixEM(y)
```
